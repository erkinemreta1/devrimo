"""Resident Agno agents, one per user, with their campus MCP subprocesses.

This is what replaced the per-user container. An entry here owns a live
``Agent`` and the MCP subprocesses its toolkits spawned, so the same questions
the container runtime answered — when does a user's agent come up, when does it
go away, what happens when their toolset changes — are answered here instead.

Two things make this cheaper than the containers were. Building an entry costs
one process spawn per connected campus server rather than a container start, so
a cold user is seconds rather than tens of seconds. And nothing is lost by
evicting one: conversation history lives in the database (see
:mod:`app.agents.store`), not on a volume, so eviction is invisible to the
student beyond the next turn being slightly slower.

Concurrency: entries are created under a per-user lock, so two simultaneous
first turns build one agent rather than two sets of subprocesses. The lock is
*not* held across a model turn — that is the database turn lock's job
(:func:`app.agents.manager.acquire_turn_lock`), which also works across
replicas, as this pool does not.
