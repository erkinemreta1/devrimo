"""Deterministic intent classification, context selection and answer guidance.

A turn gets the whole tool surface and the student's context either way; what it
does not get is a stable shape for the answer, so two questions of the same kind
come back in two different formats - one prerequisite answer was a table and the
next was prose with a typo in it.

The classifier is deliberately keyword-based. A model call to classify the
intent would cost the latency and tokens this exists to save, and the intents
below are the ones the tools already answer deterministically; anything the
patterns do not recognise stays "other" and keeps the full context.
