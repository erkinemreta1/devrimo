"""Turn a student's campus server specs into connected Agno toolkits.

This is the module that actually spawns campus MCP servers. Everything it
launches is a subprocess of the broker, so two properties matter and are
enforced here rather than left to a caller:

* **One env per server.** Each :class:`~agno.tools.mcp.MCPTools` is built from
  its own :class:`mcp.StdioServerParameters`, so a server sees only the
  credentials its catalog entry asked for. The MCP SDK merges that env over
  ``get_default_environment()`` — ``HOME``/``LOGNAME``/``PATH``/``SHELL``/
  ``TERM``/``USER`` only — so the broker's own ``SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY``,
  ``DATABASE_URL``, and model-provider key are never inherited by a scraper.

* **``server_params`` and never ``command``.** ``MCPTools.__init__`` rebuilds
  ``server_params`` from scratch when ``command`` is also passed, silently
  dropping ``cwd`` — which odtuclass needs, because it caches its Moodle
  session token relative to its working directory.
