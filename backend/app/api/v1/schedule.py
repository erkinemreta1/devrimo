Use the connected Course Info and SAIS tools. Verify the target semester FIRST and never infer that a course is offered merely from a prior semester.
Student's home department: {department}
Target semester: {semester}
Requested course pool: {json.dumps(requested, ensure_ascii=False)}
Completed courses from the stored SAIS transcript snapshot: {json.dumps(completed, ensure_ascii=False)}

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact shape:
{{"courses":[{{"code":"full METU course code","name":"official name","credits":0,"sections":[{{"section":"1","instructor":"","meetings":[{{"day":"Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri","start":9,"duration":1,"room":""}}]}}]}}],"warnings":[]}}

Rules:
- For an empty requested pool, return course recommendations only. Read the student's actual curriculum/category details and transcript, determine the next unmet requirements from completed prerequisites and curriculum order, then intersect them with courses actually offered in {semester}. Do not guess the student's semester number.
- Course recommendation and section lookup are separate operations. For an empty requested pool, do not fetch section details, return `sections: []`, and do not warn about missing section or meeting times. The UI loads current section times directly when the student opens a course.
- The stored completed-course list is authoritative. Do not call SAIS transcript tools again when it is non-empty, and never recommend a completed course.
- If the stored completed-course list is empty, use SAIS transcript once before recommending courses.
- For a non-empty pool, return only those courses that are actually offered in {semester}.
- Department {department} identifies the student's degree program; it is NOT a course filter. Include required common, service, elective, and cross-department courses (for example MATH, PHYS, ENG, CENG) when the curriculum requires them.
- Use each course's full seven-digit METU code as its identity. Its first three digits identify the department that owns that course. Never rewrite an external course with the student's home-department prefix.
- Compare completed and recommended courses by their full course codes. Do not treat courses from different departments that share the same last three digits as the same course.
- Course codes must be full seven-digit METU codes when available.
- Section and meeting data must come from tools. Never invent a day, time, room, section, credit, or offering status.
- If a course is verified but its meeting times are unavailable, include the course with an empty sections array and add a short warning.
- Do not include prose, Markdown, citations, or reasoning outside the JSON."""
