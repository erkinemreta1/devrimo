"""Course catalog access for the visual schedule builder.

Every read here goes straight to the connected Course Info MCP server through
:mod:`app.campus.course_info` — no Agent run, language model, prompt, memory or
learning pass is involved anywhere in this module, and none of it costs tokens.

``/curriculum`` was the exception until it stopped being one. It ran a bounded
agent and held the same turn lock a chat turn does, which cost a median of 95.8
seconds in production and made opening the planner during a chat turn fail with
a 409. It now reads the student's own curriculum listing directly.
