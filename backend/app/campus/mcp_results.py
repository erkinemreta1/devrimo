"""One reading of an MCP tool result, shared by everything that calls one.

Agno hands back a result object whose useful payload can be in any of three
places: the protocol's ``structured_content`` metadata — typed, and what a
well-behaved server sends — a content block carrying a JSON document as text,
or a bare string. Reading only some of them is how two callers end up
disagreeing about what the same server said, which is precisely what happened
between the planning bridge and the schedule endpoints.
