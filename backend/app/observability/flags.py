"""Feature flags, evaluated per student.

The broker has several settings that today can only change by editing code or
env and redeploying: which campus servers get built, which agent profile runs,
which model answers. Every one of those is something you want to change *during*
an incident — a campus server started returning garbage, a model regressed — so
each gets a flag with the existing ``Settings`` value as its fallback.

Fallback is the whole design. With no PostHog key, no personal API key, or an
unreachable PostHog, every helper here returns the default it was given and the
broker behaves exactly as it does today. A flag lookup must never be able to
take the agent down.

The distinct id comes from the request context bound by ObservabilityMiddleware,
so flags are evaluated per student without threading a user id through call
signatures that have no other reason to know one.
